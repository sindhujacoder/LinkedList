#LinkedList and list 
# They can be used to implement  queues or stacks as well as graphs. Theyâ€™re also useful for much more complex tasks, such as lifecycle management for an operating system application.

#When you know which element you want to access, lists can perform this operation in O(1) time. Trying to do the same with a linked list would take O(n) because you need to traverse the whole list to find the element.

#search - O(n) = lists `n` linkedlists

#With all this in mind, even though inserting elements at the end of a list using .append() or .insert() will have constant time, O(1), when you try inserting an element closer to or at the beginning of the list, the average time complexity will grow along with the size of the list: O(n).

#With all this in mind, even though inserting elements at the end of a list using .append() or .insert() will have constant time, O(1), when you try inserting an element closer to or at the beginning of the list, the average time complexity will grow along with the size of the list: O(n).

#linked lists have a performance advantage over normal lists when implementing a queue (FIFO), in which elements are continuously inserted and removed at the beginning of the list

#LL perform similarly to a list when implementing a stack (LIFO), in which elements are inserted and removed at the end of the list.
